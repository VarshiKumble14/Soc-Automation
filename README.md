# SOC Automation

## Objective
To implement a fully automated Security Operations Center (SOC) by deploying a Wazuh instance for threat detection, integrating it with a SOAR platform for automated response orchestration, and establishing a comprehensive case management system using TheHive. This setup aims to enhance threat visibility, streamline incident response, and centralize investigation workflows.

### Skills Learned


- SIEM Engineering: Deployed and configured Wazuh for log analysis, intrusion detection, and rule-based alerting integrated with Elasticsearch and Kibana.
- SOAR Implementation: Built automated response playbooks using platforms like Cortex and Shuffle; automated IOC enrichment and containment workflows.
- Case Management: Configured TheHive for alert ingestion, case templating, task assignment, and observable tracking.
- Threat Intelligence Integration: Connected MISP and Cortex analyzers for real-time IOC correlation and enrichment.
- Linux: Managed deployments using Linux servers, applying security hardening and performance tuning.
- Visualization & Reporting: Designed custom Kibana dashboards to visualize threat data and SOC metrics.
- Security Frameworks: Applied MITRE ATT&CK techniques for detection logic and case classifications and patterns.

### Tools Used


- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
